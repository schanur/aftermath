## Installation
   * Clone this repository or download and entract the snapshot to a location readable to you:
     git clone https://github.com/schanur/shell-status-prompt.git
   * Add the following line to your .bashrc or .zshrc file:
     source "/path/of/this/repo/shell-status-prompt.sh"

You are done. You see your new status line after you restart your shell session.

## Contribution
I am looking for a better (shorter) and more creative name. Maybe you have a good idea.
Features missing? Give me a hint or implement it yourself and create a pull request.
If you like it (or even if you don't), a short feedback would be nice.


Thanks!
